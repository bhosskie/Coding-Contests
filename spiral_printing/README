spiral_printing.php prints a n x m 2D array in spiral order (clockwise)

The program accepts as its first argument a path to a filename.

The input file contains several lines. Each line is one test case. 

Each line contains three items (semicolon delimited). The first is 'n'(rows), the second is 'm'(columns) and the third is a single space separated list of characters/numbers in row major order.

For ex.,

I/P:

3;3;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
